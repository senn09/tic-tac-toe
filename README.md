1. Write down how you approached the project. 

- Went onto figma to create a flow chart diagram for the logic of the game. The game logic is pretty straightforward.

2. What was hard, what was easy. 

- Overall, pretty easy. Took some time to code the game winning logic. Did not include a AIÂ feature, not something I am interested in spending a lot of time on.

3. How might you improve for the next project? 

- I would add an AI feature/Computer to play against and also a GUI such as Tkinter

4. What was your biggest learning from today? 

- Spending the time to make a plan for the code is well rewarded. Everything was clear to me in terms of what I needed to do. 

- Did encounter areas of the code that needed more planning such as the game winning logic, I decided to find the simplest approach which was it being a row, col, or diagonal win. Not super fancy.

5. What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

- Not much would change since this is a fairly simple project.
